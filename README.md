# WARNING

~~**Running this counts as self-botting and is prohibited by Discord's TOS. While you are probably fine running this, there is a small chance your account is getting flagged as a self-bot and eventually terminated.**~~
Well it kinda is self-botting but running it in the client isn't as dangerous

**Use at your own risk.**

~~**In general never share your user token with any program unless you fully understand how it works and what it does.**~~
You no longer have to handle copy pasting tokens

I don't take any responsibility for any potential damage done by running this program.

## running this

1. Copy all the contents of `scrape.js`
2. Open discord & open devtools, if you are on stable then [read this](https://twitter.com/DiscordPreviews/status/1486003718063632386)
3. Wait...
4. Copy the output after the "`Done, copy the following output and paste it in scraped.json`" message and paste it in `scraped.json`
5. Run `node ./view.js [port]` and open the link

## note

~~This code is utter trash and all but I can't be bothered cleaning any of this up since it works and that's all it needs to do.~~
This code is not at all utter trash, i spent effort writing this snippet,
if you are concerned about the safety of this snippet then read the comments or
show it a trustable js dev who can guarantee you that this snippet is not at all malicious

~~It is a personal project that served it's purpose and I am not planning
on making any updates or improving the ux. If you can't get it to run
you probably shouldn't run it. I am not providing support.~~

Well I updated shit
